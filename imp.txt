1.⁠ ⁠Student Module
Smart Upload: Snap a photo of a certificate, tag it (e.g., "Workshop," "Sports"), and hit send.

Verified Resume Generator: One click to auto-generate a professional CV containing only faculty-approved achievements.

Activity Credit Meter: A progress bar showing "Points Earned" vs. "Points Needed for Graduation."

2.⁠ ⁠Faculty Module
Bulk Verify: Select 50 students from one event and approve them all in a single click.

One-Tap Rejection: Reject bad uploads instantly with preset reasons (e.g., "Image Blurry," "Wrong Date").

3.⁠ ⁠Placement Cell (Admin)
"God Mode" Search: Filter students by specific combos (e.g., "3rd Year" + "Java Skill" + "Hackathon Winner").

Instant Export: Download the verified list of eligible candidates to Excel/CSV in seconds for recruiters.

4.⁠ ⁠The "X-Factor" (Tech USP)
Tamper-Proof "Blue Tick": Every approved certificate gets a cryptographic hash. If a student tries to Photoshop it later, the system detects it instantly.
